# The Last Light

## The Last Light is based on a acopolyptic world where our main character is someone who has been cursed his entire life to live in the darkness, with nothing but a flame torch, he can only live as long as there is a flame in his torch.
But the recent acopolypse has made the poor man a hero. A demon took all the light on the planet and now the only one with light is our main 
character. Our guy makes full use of this and fights with might against the demon, trying to unlock the ultimate door where the light has 
been locked in. You have to traverse the wierd terrain of the underworld with constantly expiring torch.
